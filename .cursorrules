# Automated TODO Management System Configuration

## TODO System Settings

The project uses an automated TODO management system located in `.todos/` directory.

### Commands:
- `npm run todos:scan` - Scan codebase for TODO/FIXME/HACK
- `npm run todos:report` - Generate TODO_REPORT.md
- `npm run todos:all` - Run scan and report

### Priority Levels:
- CRITICAL: Blocking issues, requires immediate attention
- HIGH: Important tasks, FIXME, HACK
- MEDIUM: Regular TODO, optimizations
- LOW: Cosmetic improvements, documentation

### Task Status:
- OPEN: New task, not started
- IN_PROGRESS: Currently being worked on
- RESOLVED: Completed task
- TESTING: Under testing

### Auto-assignment:
Tasks are automatically assigned based on file type:
- `.go`, `.py` → backend-team
- `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx` → frontend-team
- `.sh`, `.yml`, `Dockerfile` → devops

### Pre-commit Hook:
Critical TODOs block commits. Use `git commit --no-verify` to bypass.

### Dashboard:
Open `.todos/dashboard.html` in browser for visual task tracking.
